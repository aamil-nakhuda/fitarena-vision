## 🚀 Overview

**FitArena Vision** is the world’s first real‑time feedback and real-time gamified workout app using computer‑vision pose estimation technology that is designed to transform traditional workouts into immersive, gamified experiences. Using real-time pose estimation via computer vision, it delivers instant feedback. This system aims to solve key challenges in modern fitness including lack of motivation, improper form, and accessibility barriers.

The project was conceptualized and executed as a solo participant for both the M.Sc. (IT) degree research project and Aavishkar Research Convention.
